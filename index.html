  <div class=heavy-rounded>
     <p>My name is Dareen, and I am a student at Bethlehem University. I am 	double-majoring in software engineering, and I will graduate in 2023 with bachelor’s degrees. </p>
     <p>In my childhood I have been very passionate about physics and chemistry, so I have been dreaming for a very long time to have a job that requires a lot of math and physics to understand well. When I was a undergrad, I have done a research about a technology that allowed us to use electrical-chemical interaction to have a safer nuclear power station</p>
    <p>Since then, I have been living in the town next to the nuclear power station, this research choice was well considerated by my concerned parents, they are one of the scientists working in the station. Since, I have been living in the station, I have been exposed to many radioactive things, this is why my cell's body doesn't have all the elements, but there are so many other things, the station workers have exposed me to, so I have been exposed to too many things, so I can't be exposed to any kinds of radioactivity, that's why I'm now in the capital.<p>

<div class=heavy-rounded>
    <p> Jerusalem is not just any old land but the oldest land on earth that unites three different religions. It is referred as “The Heart of the World”. This land unites Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Each religion finds Jerusalem sacred in its own way. Coming from this Holy Land, I have observed the significance of Jerusalem to these three monotheistic religions.</p>

<h3> Reading</h3>
   <p> I’m passionate about reading. Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies and hiking, reading books is what resonates well with me. There are many reasons why I love reading. The first reason is it gives me a level of fulfillment. That is, books rejuvenate me. After reading a book, I feel like a whole new being and my outlook in life changes.

<h3> Traveling </h3>
   <p>Traveling is one of those few activities that has a kind of reset button in our lives. You go away for a few days or weeks and come back fresh and ready to take on challenges of life head on. Traveling to many people is a matter of convenience, rather than a recreation activity. They only travel when they have an issue to attend to. Traveling is also not for escapists, as many people tend to believe. I used the word ‘escapists’ not in the literary sense of the word, but rather to mean people who run away from their problems. Traveling is a hobby like any other. Most people do not understand how moving from one place to another can be categorized together with fun activities like watching movies, swimming, dancing or drawing. While it has more challenges than other hobbies, it is more adventurous and brings the same level of satisfaction or more for those who love it.</p>

<h3> Listening to music </h3>
   <p>Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be traced back to when I was a child. There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was played. I would run to the stereo, turn on the music to full volume and start running around dancing. Anyone who dared touch the sound system would face my wrath. Music was the only thing that could calm me down whenever I cried. I always have this weird feeling that my destiny is somehow intertwined with music. In my early teenage years, my girlfriends and I would sneak into the garage, where my brother and his band mates kept their musical equipment. Then, we would pluck guitar strings and knock the drums in an effort to compose our favorite songs. I was the lead singer by the way.</p>

<div class=heavy-rounded>
   <p> my university have many advantages for  students. There's a lot of different courses to study, diverse student groups, good education. And the campus is close to the city center, a lovely campus attracts students.</p>

<p>my university have many faculties. In one of them all the faculties seemed to be in a heated commotion. At the end of the corridor near the entrance was a group of students in a semi-circle. They were in a heated debate about something, but their voices were muffled. All the commotion was because a member of one of the faculties had shown a poster which was a reminder about the exams. The debate was in a rather heated situation, but since no participants in the semi-circle were from the affected faculty, they didn't pay much attention to that.</p>
