    <h2>My city</h2>
    <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Jerusalem city" width="500" height="333">

    <p> Jerusalem is not just any old land but the oldest land on earth that unites three different religions. It is referred as “The Heart of the World”. This land unites Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Each religion finds Jerusalem sacred in its own way. Coming from this Holy Land, I have observed the significance of Jerusalem to these three monotheistic religions.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
   <p> I’m passionate about reading. Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies and hiking, reading books is what resonates well with me. There are many reasons why I love reading. The first reason is it gives me a level of fulfillment. That is, books rejuvenate me. After reading a book, I feel like a whole new being and my outlook in life changes.
